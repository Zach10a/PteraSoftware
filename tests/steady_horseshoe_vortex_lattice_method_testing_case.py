"""This is a testing case for the steady horseshoe vortex lattice method solver.

    Based on an identical XFLR5 testing case, the expected output for this case is:
        CL:     0.790
        CDi:    0.019
        Cl:     0.000
        Cm:     -0.690
        Cn:     0.000

    Note: The expected output was created using XFLR5's inviscid VLM1 analysis type, which is a horseshoe vortex
    lattice method solver.
