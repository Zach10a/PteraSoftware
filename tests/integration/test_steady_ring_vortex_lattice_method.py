""" This module is a testing case for the steady ring vortex lattice method solver.

Based on an identical XFLR5 testing case, the expected output for this case is:
    CL:     0.788
    CDi:    0.019
    Cm:     -0.687

Note: The expected output was created using XFLR5's inviscid VLM2 analysis type, which is a ring vortex lattice method
solver.
