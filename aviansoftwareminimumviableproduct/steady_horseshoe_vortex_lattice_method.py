        This function takes in the type of problem this panel will be used in, and initializes the appropriate vortices.

        For the "steady horseshoe vortex lattice method" problem type:
            Every panel has a horseshoe vortex. The vortex's finite leg runs along the panel's quarter chord from right
            to left. It's infinite legs point backwards in the positive x direction.

        For the "steady ring vortex lattice method" problem type:
            The panel's ring vortex is a quadrangle whose front vortex leg is at the panel's quarter chord. The left and
            right vortex legs run along the panel's left and right legs. They extend backwards and meet the back vortex
            leg at one quarter chord back from the panel's back leg.

            Panels that are at the trailing edge of a wing have a horseshoe vortex in addition to their ring vortex. The
            horseshoe vortex's finite leg runs along the ring vortex's back leg but in the opposite direction. It's
            infinite legs point backwards in the positive x direction. The ring vortex and horseshoe vortex have the
            same strength, so the back leg of the ring vortex is cancelled.
