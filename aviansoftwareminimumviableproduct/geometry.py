    This class contains the following public methods:
        populate_coordinates: This method populates a variable with the coordinates of the airfoil.
        populate_mcl_coordinates: This method creates a list of the airfoil's mean camber line coordinates. It also
                                  creates two lists of the vectors needed to go from the mcl coordinates to the upper
                                  and lower surfaces. It also creates list of the thicknesses at the x coordinates along
                                  the mean camber line.
        leading_edge_index: This method returns the index of the point along the leading edge.
        lower_coordinates: This method returns a matrix of x and y coordinates that describe the lower surface of the
                           airfoil.
        upper_coordinates: This method returns a matrix of x and y coordinates that describe the upper surface of the
                           airfoil.
        get_downsampled_mcl: This method returns the mean camber line in a downsampled form.
        get_camber_at_chord_fraction: This method returns the camber of the airfoil at a given fraction of the chord.
        repanel_current_airfoil: This method returns a repaneled version of the airfoil with cosine-spaced coordinates
                                 on the upper and lower surfaces.
        add_control_surface: This method returns a version of the airfoil with a control surface added at a given point.
